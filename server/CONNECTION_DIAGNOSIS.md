# üîç AWS RDS Connection Issue Diagnosis

## Root Cause Identified
Your system has **IPv6-only networking** with no IPv4 routes, but the AWS RDS instance is primarily accessible via IPv4.

## Evidence:
1. ‚úÖ DNS Resolution works: `database-1.cv62gywq2djb.eu-north-1.rds.amazonaws.com` ‚Üí `16.16.50.81`
2. ‚ùå IPv4 connectivity fails: "Network is unreachable"
3. ‚úÖ IPv6 connectivity exists: Your current IP is IPv6 (`2409:40f2:104f:a719:97f0:fcb8:6cbc:db8e`)
4. ‚ùå No IPv4 routing table entries found

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Force IPv4 Connection (Recommended)
Update your Node.js PostgreSQL connection to use IPv4 explicitly:

```javascript
const client = new Client({
  host: '16.16.50.81',  // Use IPv4 directly
  port: 5432,
  database: 'postgres',
  user: 'postgres',
  password: 'postgres',
  ssl: {
    require: true,
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  }
});
```

### Option 2: Network Configuration
Configure IPv4 networking on your system (may require system admin access).

### Option 3: AWS VPC IPv6 Support
Configure your AWS RDS to support IPv6 (advanced AWS networking).

## AWS Security Group Note
Your security group configuration is likely correct. The issue is network layer connectivity, not firewall rules.

## Next Steps
1. Test with IPv4 address directly
2. If successful, update application configuration
3. For production, ensure proper IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack setup

## Test Command
After implementing the fix:
```bash
node test-connection-ipv4.js
```
